This project provides a simple Python script that converts PNG images to WEBP format. It leverages the Pillow library for image manipulation and offers options to adjust the compression quality. The script supports batch conversion of multiple PNG files from a specified directory, making it easy to optimize images for web usage or reduce file sizes for storage.

Features:

	•	Convert single or multiple PNG images to WEBP format.
	•	Adjustable compression level to balance between image quality and file size.
	•	Optional lossless conversion mode for images requiring no quality degradation.
	•	Automatically processes all PNG files in a specified directory.
	•	Creates an output directory for storing converted images.

How to Use:

	1.	Place all PNG files in the input_images folder.
	2.	Specify the desired output directory and compression quality in the script.
	3.	Run the Python script, and the converted WEBP files will be saved in the output folder.

Requirements:

	•	Python 3.x
	•	Pillow (pip install pillow)

This tool is perfect for developers looking to optimize images for the web or anyone needing efficient image compression in the WEBP format.
